# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Important: Development Build Required**

   This app uses MapLibre React Native, which requires native code. You **cannot** use Expo Go. You need to create a development build instead.

   See [Development Build Setup Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_BUILD_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

   **Quick start:**
   - For iOS: Install Xcode, then run `npx expo run:ios`
   - For Android: Install Android Studio, then run `npx expo run:android`

3. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npx expo start --dev-client
   ```

   This connects to your development build instead of Expo Go.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
